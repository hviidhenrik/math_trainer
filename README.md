# Math Trainer

## Purpose and idea

Welcome to Math Trainer. When this project started in early 2020, 
the purpose of this Python program was twofold:
 1) To train my python skills
 2) To train my mental math skills

However, nowadays I've learned Python much more through my 
work, so the purpose is now just to train my mental math 
abilities and have fun developing this project further.

The program is easy to use. Simply run main.py and the 
prompt will guide you through the rest of the process 
from choosing a type of math problem to which file to save 
your results to. 

## To be added

New types of problems are added every now and then, when 
I feel like it. The current back log of things to do is 
as listed below:

- implement general approximation of otherwise "difficult" problems, e.g. large multiplication problems
- implement log approximation mode
- make text to speech mode able to pose problems in English (currently only Danish)
- make saved dataframe store number of posed questions as there seems to be a slight fatigue
  when doing many questions versus a few, which pulls up mean time slightly
- implement multiplication tables mode  
- implement "mixed mode" which poses a random mix of selected problem types
- implement percentage approximation mode
- implement linear equation solving mode (e.g. 3 + x = 5, find x)
- make questions that were incorrect more likely to be posed again (like boosting) until correct  
- make time series plot of historical response times or scores from data frames
- make some unit tests  
- make graphical interface (probably never gonna happen)
